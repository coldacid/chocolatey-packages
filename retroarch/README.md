# RetroArch

RetroArch is a frontend for libretro, an open API which exposes the functionality of a game, emulator or certain kinds of multimedia applications. libretro started as libsnes with the SNES emulator bSNES, but libretro has since become a far broader API. RetroArch builds around the libretro API to provide a powerful interface for libretro cores.
